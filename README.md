# 1610CH-git-demo

This is an exercise to help you guys get acquainted with useful git commands and working in a team!

Quick recap:
- What are the needs for the project? Discuss with the team.
- Open up issues when appropriate and assign them to team members. Communicate!
- When working on a feature, checkout to a branch with a descriptive name
  * When checking out from a branch, remember to set the correct base (instead of master)!
- Make your modifications, and commit at regular intervals
- When you're done with the feature, push and open a pull request (PR)
- A team member (or more realistically in the working world, a senior/manager) should review your code
- If all looks good, it will be merged into master (in principle, you shouldn't be merging your own PRs)

In case of merge conflicts... PANIC!
No, don't panic! Github has a great new interface that makes it easy now!
We will try to induce a merge conflict so we can practice resolving it.

List of useful commands:
- init
- pull
- push
- add
- commit
- merge
- fetch

----

These are the primary tasks to accomplish:
- Define schema for database models
- Add a couple more API routes
- Set up React Router to show correct views
- Flesh out a couple React Components I started for you

Open up issues for the tasks as you see fit and divide them amongst your team.
Remember to communicate!

There are more details written throughout the app (as comments).
Please read them for reference.

As always, `npm install` and `npm start` to fire it up! Good luck and have fun :-)
