# 1610CH-git-demo

This is an exercise to help you guys get acquainted with useful git commands and working in a team!

Quick recap:
- What are the needs for the project? Discuss with the team.
- Open up issues when appropriate and assign them to team members. Communicate!
- When working on a feature, checkout to a branch with a descriptive name
  * when checking out from a branch, remember to set the correct base (instead of master)!
- Made your modifications, and commit as regular intervals
- When you've accomplished your feature, push and open a pull request (PR)
- A team member should review your code
- If all looks good, merge into master

In case of merge conflicts... PANIC!
No, don't panic! Github has a great new interface that makes it easy now!

List of useful commands:
- init
- pull
- push
- add
- commit
- merge
(- fetch)

These are the primary tasks to accomplish:
- Define schema for database models
- Add a couple more API routes
- Set up React Router to show the correct views
- Flesh out a couple React Components I started for you

There are more details embedded throughout the app (block comments with things I'm asking for).
Please review them for reference.

Open up issues for the tasks as you see fit and divide them amongst your team.
Remember to communicate!

As always, `npm install` and `npm start` to fire it up! Good luck and have fun :-)
